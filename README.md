Task tracker app for the terminal with Python (Rich, Typer, Sqlite3)..

This app helps to add, delete, update, and complete daily tasks on the terminal. 

☑️ Built a terminal application (CLI app) to manage my tasks and todos. 

☑️ Used Typer for building the CLI app, Rich for a colorized terminal output, and SQLite for the database.
